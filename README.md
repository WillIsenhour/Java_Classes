GetValidInput - 
Widget that validates numeric command line input through the console.
To return an integer between 0 and 547000: 
  GetValidInput.getInteger(0, 547000, "Enter a number between 0 and 547,000")
The class will then prompt the user through a process and return a value of type int between
the minimum and maximum values, in this case 0 and 547,000.
